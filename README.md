# Software 3D renderer

This is my attempt at a software 3d renderer / rasterizer, following Pikuma's excellent course on 3D graphics programming.

## Prerequisites

Compiler flags are set up for MacOS ARM64 architecture.

Make sure SDL2 is installed on your system. 

This can be installed with `brew install sdl2` on MacOS.

## Compile and run program

Compile and run program with `make && make run`.

## 3D assets

Alternative OBJ file data can be loaded from the `/assets/` folder.

You can easily create a custom object of your own in something like `Blender`
and then save it to the `/assets` folder. Remember to save it as an `.obj`
file.
